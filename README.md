The purpose of EXXA is to use machine learning to analyze exoplanets, their systems, and their formation. 

Astronomical data often takes the form of images, so expertise in computer vision techniques is often essential for understanding and working with observations. Telescopes, such as ALMA, Kepler and NASA, produce publicly available data that can be used (with proper citations) by amateur and professional researchers alike. However, research often supplements this data with synthetic data from simulations.
